1	LESLEY STAHL	Do you still think that climate change is a hoax?
2	TRUMP	I think something's happening.
3	TRUMP	Something's changing and it'll change back again.
4	TRUMP	I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference.
5	TRUMP	But I don't know that it's manmade.
6	TRUMP	I will say this.
7	TRUMP	I don't wanna give trillions and trillions of dollars.
8	TRUMP	I don't wanna lose millions and millions of jobs.
9	TRUMP	I don't wanna be put at a disadvantage.
10	LESLEY STAHL	I wish you could go to Greenland, watch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the ocean, raising the sea levels.
11	TRUMP	And you don't know whether or not that would have happened with or without man.
12	TRUMP	You don't know.
13	LESLEY STAHL	Well, your scientists, your scientists--
14	TRUMP	No, we have--
15	LESLEY STAHL	At NOAA and NASA--
16	TRUMP	We have scientists that disagree with that.
17	LESLEY STAHL	You know, I was thinking what if he said, "No, I've seen the hurricane situations, I've changed my mind. There really is climate change."
18	LESLEY STAHL	And I thought, "Wow, what an impact."
19	TRUMP	Well-- I'm not denying.
20	LESLEY STAHL	What an impact that would make.
21	TRUMP	I'm not denying climate change.
22	TRUMP	But it could very well go back.
23	TRUMP	You know, we're talkin' about over a millions--
24	LESLEY STAHL	But that's denying it.
25	TRUMP	--of years.
26	TRUMP	They say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than what we just had with Michael.
27	LESLEY STAHL	Who says that?
28	LESLEY STAHL	"They say?"
29	TRUMP	People say.
30	TRUMP	People say that in the--
31	LESLEY STAHL	Yeah, but what about the scientists who say it's worse than ever?
32	TRUMP	You'd have to show me the scientists because they have a very big political agenda, Lesley.
33	LESLEY STAHL	I can't bring them in.
34	TRUMP	Look, scientists also have a political agenda.
35	LESLEY STAHL	Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist--
36	TRUMP	Yes.
37	TRUMP	Yes.
38	LESLEY STAHL	--the Saudi journalist, was he murdered by the Saudis?
39	LESLEY STAHL	And did the prince give the order to kill him?
40	TRUMP	Nobody knows yet, but we'll probably be able to find out.
41	TRUMP	It's being investigated.
42	TRUMP	It's being looked at very, very strongly.
43	TRUMP	And we would be very upset and angry if that were the case.
44	TRUMP	As of this moment, they deny it.
45	TRUMP	And den-- deny it vehemently.
46	TRUMP	Could it be them?
47	TRUMP	Yes.
48	LESLEY STAHL	Jared, your son-in-law.
49	LESLEY STAHL	Got on the phone and asked the prince.
50	LESLEY STAHL	Did he deny it?
51	LESLEY STAHL	Did he--
52	TRUMP	They deny it.
53	TRUMP	They deny it every way you can imagine.
54	TRUMP	In the not-too-distant future, I think we'll know an answer.
55	LESLEY STAHL	What are you options?
56	LESLEY STAHL	Let's say they did.
57	LESLEY STAHL	What are your options?
58	LESLEY STAHL	Would you consider imposing sanctions, as a bipartisan group of senators have proposed?
59	TRUMP	Well, it depends on what the sanction is.
60	TRUMP	I'll give ya an example.
61	TRUMP	They are ordering military equipment.
62	TRUMP	Everybody in the world wanted that order.
63	TRUMP	Russia wanted it, China wanted it, we wanted it.
64	TRUMP	We got it.
65	LESLEY STAHL	So would you cut that off--
66	TRUMP	I tell you what I don't wanna do.
67	TRUMP	Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon, all these com-- I don't wanna hurt jobs.
68	TRUMP	I don't wanna lose an order like that.
69	TRUMP	There are other ways of-- punishing, to use a word that's a pretty harsh word, but it's true.
70	LESLEY STAHL	Tell everybody what's at stake here.
71	LESLEY STAHL	You know---
72	TRUMP	Well, there's a lot at stake.
73	TRUMP	There's a lot at stake.
74	TRUMP	And maybe especially so because this man was a reporter.
75	TRUMP	There's something-- you'll be surprised to hear me say that.
76	TRUMP	There's something really terrible and disgusting about that, if that were the case.
77	TRUMP	So we're gonna have to see.
78	TRUMP	We're going to get to the bottom of it and there will be severe punishment.
79	LESLEY STAHL	You've had a string of wins lately.
80	LESLEY STAHL	Let's see, the economy, the d-- the trade deal-
81	TRUMP	Right.
82	LESLEY STAHL	With Canada and Mexico, Kavanaugh--
83	TRUMP	And South Korea.
84	LESLEY STAHL	And South Korea.
85	LESLEY STAHL	And Kavanaugh, the confirmation.
86	TRUMP	There has been no administration in the history of our country, and I say this openly and proudly, that in its first two years--
87	LESLEY STAHL	Say, this is modesty.
88	TRUMP	Well, it's not even that, it's a fact Tax cuts, regulation cuts, the biggest regulations cuts in history.
89	LESLEY STAHL	What about North Korea?
90	LESLEY STAHL	Talking about accom--
91	TRUMP	Well, I consider it a, so far, great achievement.
92	TRUMP	Look, we--
93	LESLEY STAHL	You say "so far"?
94	TRUMP	It's always so far, til everything's done.
95	TRUMP	I-- I-- you know, deals are deals, okay?
96	TRUMP	Whether it's a real estate deal or a retail deal, it doesn't matter.
97	TRUMP	But I will say this.
98	TRUMP	The day before I came in, we were goin' to war with North Korea.
99	TRUMP	I sat with President Obama--
100	LESLEY STAHL	We were goin' to war?
101	TRUMP	--and-- we were gonna--I think it was going to end up in war.
102	TRUMP	And my impression is-- and even in my first few months, I mean, that rhetoric was as tough as it could possibly get.
103	TRUMP	Doesn't get any tougher than that.
104	TRUMP	Nobody's ever heard rhetoric that tough.
105	TRUMP	We were going to war with North Korea.
106	TRUMP	Now, you don't hear that.
107	TRUMP	You don't hear any talk of it.
108	TRUMP	And he doesn't wanna go to war, and we don't wanna go to war, and he understands denuclearization and he's agreed to it.
109	TRUMP	And you see that, he's agreed to it.
110	TRUMP	No missiles.
111	LESLEY STAHL	Do you trust him?
112	TRUMP	I do trust him, yeah, I trust him.
113	TRUMP	That doesn't mean I can't be proven wrong --
114	LESLEY STAHL	Why would--
115	TRUMP	about it?
116	LESLEY STAHL	you trust him?
117	TRUMP	Well, first of all, if I didn't trust him, I wouldn't say that to you.
118	TRUMP	Wouldn't I be foolish to tell you right here, on 60 Minutes--
119	LESLEY STAHL	Well, remember what Reagan said.
120	LESLEY STAHL	"Trust, but verify."
121	TRUMP	Sure.
122	TRUMP	I know.
123	TRUMP	It's-- it's very true.
124	TRUMP	But the fact is, I do trust him.
125	TRUMP	But we'll see what happens.
126	LESLEY STAHL	But is it true that they haven't gotten rid of a single weapon, and they may actually be building more missiles-
127	TRUMP	They want to--
128	LESLEY STAHL	With nuclear--
129	TRUMP	And I will tell you that they're closing up sites.
130	LESLEY STAHL	But--
131	TRUMP	Setting it up.
132	LESLEY STAHL	Is what I said true, that they haven't?
133	LESLEY STAHL	Gotten--
134	TRUMP	Well, nobody really knows.
135	TRUMP	I mean, people are saying that.
136	TRUMP	I've actually said that.
137	LESLEY STAHL	What?
138	LESLEY STAHL	That they're still building missiles, more missiles?
139	TRUMP	We don't really know, Lesley.
140	TRUMP	We really don't know.
141	TRUMP	But I assume--
142	LESLEY STAHL	Suspect that?
143	TRUMP	Let's say the answer is yes, okay?
144	TRUMP	In the meantime, they haven't tested a missile.
145	TRUMP	They haven't tested a rocket.
146	TRUMP	They definitely haven't done a nuclear test because you know about them real fast.
147	TRUMP	It sort of moves the earth.
148	TRUMP	And we have a relationship now.
149	LESLEY STAHL	One of the things that Kim has asked for is for you to ease the sanctions.
150	TRUMP	We haven't done that.
151	LESLEY STAHL	Are you prepared to do that?
152	LESLEY STAHL	What-- what does he have to do--
153	TRUMP	No, no.
154	TRUMP	I--
155	LESLEY STAHL	Before you're--
156	TRUMP	No I'm not doing it.
157	TRUMP	This isn't the Obama administration.
158	TRUMP	I haven't eased the sanctions.
159	TRUMP	I haven't done anything.
160	TRUMP	I haven't done anything.
161	TRUMP	We're meeting.
162	TRUMP	I believe he likes me.
163	TRUMP	I like him.
164	TRUMP	We have a good relationship.
165	TRUMP	It's very important.
166	LESLEY STAHL	I wanna read you his resume, okay?
167	LESLEY STAHL	He presides over a cruel kingdom of repression, gulags, starvation-- reports that he had his half-brother assassinated, slave labor, public executions.
168	LESLEY STAHL	This is a guy you love?
169	TRUMP	Sure.
170	TRUMP	I know all these things.
171	TRUMP	I mean-- I'm not a baby.
172	TRUMP	I know these things.
173	LESLEY STAHL	I know, but why do you love that guy?
174	TRUMP	Look, look.
175	TRUMP	I-- I-- I like-- I get along with him, okay?
176	LESLEY STAHL	But you love him.
177	TRUMP	Okay.
178	TRUMP	That's just a figure of speech.
179	LESLEY STAHL	No, it's like an embrace.
180	TRUMP	It well, let it be an embrace.
181	TRUMP	Let it be whatever it is to get the job done.
182	LESLEY STAHL	He's a bad guy.
183	TRUMP	Look.
184	TRUMP	Let it be whatever it is.
185	TRUMP	I get along with him really well.
186	TRUMP	I have a good energy with him.
187	TRUMP	I have a good chemistry with him.
188	TRUMP	Look at the horrible threats that were made.
189	TRUMP	No more threats.
190	TRUMP	No more threats.
191	LESLEY STAHL	China.
192	TRUMP	I get along with him.
193	TRUMP	It's very important.
194	TRUMP	China, let's go.
195	LESLEY STAHL	I'm skipping across the world here.
196	LESLEY STAHL	You've slapped a lot of tariffs--
197	TRUMP	$250 billion.
198	LESLEY STAHL	Gonna do more?
199	TRUMP	Might.
200	TRUMP	Might.
201	LESLEY STAHL	Round three?
202	TRUMP	They wanna negotiate, Lesley.
203	TRUMP	They wanna negotiate.
204	LESLEY STAHL	Are you ready?
205	TRUMP	Look.
206	LESLEY STAHL	Are you ready to--
207	TRUMP	I have a great chemistry also with President Xi of China.
208	TRUMP	I don't know that that's necessarily going to continue.
209	TRUMP	I told President Xi we cannot continue to have China take $500 billion a year out of the United States in the form of trade and others things.
210	LESLEY STAHL	And how-- how--
211	TRUMP	And I said we can't do that, and we're not gonna do that anymore.
212	LESLEY STAHL	How much squeezing of them are you prepared to do when American products are gonna be more expensive for American consumers in the end of all this?
213	TRUMP	Okay.
214	TRUMP	Okay.
215	TRUMP	So, so far, that hasn't turned out to be the case.
216	LESLEY STAHL	Some--
217	TRUMP	--if you think about it, so far, I put 25% tariffs on steel dumping, and aluminum dumping 10%.
218	LESLEY STAHL	But they've--
219	TRUMP	--again.
220	LESLEY STAHL	--retaliated.
221	LESLEY STAHL	That's what I'm asking.
222	TRUMP	They can retaliate, but they can't-- they don't have enough ammunition to retaliate.
223	TRUMP	We do $100 billion with them.
224	TRUMP	They do $531 billion with us.
225	LESLEY STAHL	Are you trying to sort of push them into a depression?
226	TRUMP	No no, although they're down 32 percent in four months, which is 1929.
227	LESLEY STAHL	Well that's what I'm asking.
228	TRUMP	I don't want that.
229	TRUMP	No, I don't want that.
230	TRUMP	I want them to negotiate a fair deal with us.
231	TRUMP	I want them to open their markets like our-- our markets are open.
232	LESLEY STAHL	But you're in a--
233	TRUMP	And it will be a fair deal--
234	LESLEY STAHL	--trade war right now.
235	LESLEY STAHL	Trade war.
236	TRUMP	You call it war, I don't call--
237	LESLEY STAHL	You-- you--
238	TRUMP	--it--
239	LESLEY STAHL	--you did today.
240	TRUMP	I called it a skirmish.
241	LESLEY STAHL	I heard you, you called it a war.
242	TRUMP	I called it, actually I called it a battle.
243	TRUMP	But, actually, I'm gonna lower that.
244	TRUMP	I consider it a skirmish.
245	TRUMP	And we're gonna win.
246	LESLEY STAHL	You have also slapped some tariffs on our allies.
247	TRUMP	I mean, what's an ally?
248	TRUMP	We have wonderful relationships with a lot of people.
249	TRUMP	But nobody treats us much worse than the European Union.
250	TRUMP	The European Union was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade, and that's what they've done.
251	LESLEY STAHL	But this is hostile.
252	TRUMP	And yet, they-- it's not hostile.
253	LESLEY STAHL	It sounds hostile.
254	TRUMP	You know what's hostile?
255	TRUMP	The way they treat us.
256	TRUMP	We're not hostile.
257	LESLEY STAHL	No, but can't you deal with--
258	TRUMP	We've been-- we've been--
259	LESLEY STAHL	--them without--
260	TRUMP	--the stupid country for so many years.
261	LESLEY STAHL	Are you willing to get rid of that Western alliance?
262	TRUMP	Now, I like NATO, NATO's fine.
263	TRUMP	But you know what?
264	TRUMP	We shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect Europe.
265	TRUMP	And then on top of that, they take advantage of us on trade.
266	TRUMP	They're not going to do it anymore.
267	TRUMP	They understand that.
268	LESLEY STAHL	Okay, but are, it does seem this, are you willing to disrupt the Western Alliance?
269	LESLEY STAHL	It's been going for 70 years.
270	LESLEY STAHL	It's kept the peace for 70 years.
271	TRUMP	You don't know that.
272	TRUMP	You don't know that.
273	LESLEY STAHL	I don't know what?
274	TRUMP	You don't know that.
275	LESLEY STAHL	Is it true General Mattis said to you, "The reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances is to prevent World War III?"
276	TRUMP	No, it's not true.
277	LESLEY STAHL	What's not true?
278	TRUMP	Frankly, I like General Mattis.
279	TRUMP	I think I know more about it than he does.
280	TRUMP	And I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness, that I can tell you.
281	LESLEY STAHL	I'm gonna try one more time.
282	LESLEY STAHL	Okay.
283	TRUMP	I know-- and, Lesley, you don't have to try again.
284	TRUMP	I know exactly what you're saying--
285	LESLEY STAHL	Well, answer my question.
286	TRUMP	The answer is this.
287	TRUMP	I will always be there with NATO, but they have to pay their way.
288	TRUMP	I'm fully in favor of NATO, but I don't wanna be taken advantage of.
289	LESLEY STAHL	Putin.
290	TRUMP	Yeah.
291	LESLEY STAHL	Okay, people don't understand why you never have a harsh word for Vladimir Putin.
292	TRUMP	Okay, you ready?
293	LESLEY STAHL	I don't understand it.
294	TRUMP	I have been-- you don't know what I talked about with Putin in the meeting prior to the press conference--
295	LESLEY STAHL	No, I mean publicly.
296	LESLEY STAHL	You never say anything harsh about him--
297	TRUMP	Excuse me.
298	LESLEY STAHL	--publicly.
299	TRUMP	I didn't?
300	TRUMP	I'm the one that gave Ukraine offensive weapons and tank killers.
301	TRUMP	Obama didn't.
302	TRUMP	You know what he sent?
303	TRUMP	He sent pillows and blankets.
304	TRUMP	I'm the one-- and he's the one that gave away a part of Ukraine where Russia now has this--
305	LESLEY STAHL	Well, I mean him personally Vladimir Putin--
306	TRUMP	I think I'm very tough with him personally.
307	TRUMP	I had a meeting with him.
308	TRUMP	The two of us.
309	TRUMP	It was a very tough meeting and it was a very good meeting.
310	LESLEY STAHL	Do you agree that Vladimir Putin is involved in assassinations?
311	LESLEY STAHL	In poisonings?
312	TRUMP	Probably he is, yeah.
313	TRUMP	Probably.
314	TRUMP	I mean, I don't--
315	LESLEY STAHL	Probably?
316	TRUMP	But I rely on them, it's not in our country.
317	LESLEY STAHL	Why not-- they shouldn't do it.
318	LESLEY STAHL	This is a terrible thing.
319	TRUMP	Of course they shouldn't do it-
320	LESLEY STAHL	Instead do you believe--
321	TRUMP	That's your (Inaudible.)--
322	LESLEY STAHL	--do you believe that the Russians interfered in the 2016 campaign election?
323	LESLEY STAHL	Our election-
324	TRUMP	They-- they meddled.
325	TRUMP	But I think China meddled too.
326	LESLEY STAHL	But why do you--
327	TRUMP	And I think other countries--
328	LESLEY STAHL	--say China meddled too?
329	TRUMP	And you wanna know something?
330	LESLEY STAHL	Why do you say Chi-- why don't you just say--
331	TRUMP	Well, let me ask you--
332	LESLEY STAHL	--the Russians meddled?
333	TRUMP	Because I think China meddled also.
334	TRUMP	And I think, frankly, China--
335	LESLEY STAHL	This is amazing.
336	TRUMP	--is a bigger problem.
337	LESLEY STAHL	You are diverting the whole Russia thing.
338	TRUMP	I'm not doing anything.
339	LESLEY STAHL	You are, you are
340	TRUMP	I'm saying Russia, but I'm also saying China.
341	LESLEY STAHL	What about the attorney general, Jeff Sessions?
342	TRUMP	Well, we'll see what happens come midterms.
343	TRUMP	But--
344	LESLEY STAHL	But everybody thinks, given the things you've said--
345	TRUMP	I was disappointed that he recused himself and many people think I was right on that.
346	TRUMP	I was very disappointed.
347	TRUMP	Why should he have recused himself?
348	TRUMP	So I was very--
349	LESLEY STAHL	So--
350	TRUMP	--disappointed but--
351	LESLEY STAHL	So can I assume--
352	TRUMP	--we'll see what happens.
353	LESLEY STAHL	Can I assume he's gone?
354	TRUMP	No.
355	TRUMP	No.
356	TRUMP	You can't assume that.
357	LESLEY STAHL	Will you.
358	LESLEY STAHL	Will you pledge-- pledge that you will not shut down the Mueller investigation?
359	TRUMP	Well, I-- I don't pledge anything.
360	TRUMP	But I will tell you, I have no intention of doing that.
361	TRUMP	I think it's a very unfair investigation because there was no collusion of any kind.
362	LESLEY STAHL	But you won't pledge--
363	TRUMP	There is no collusion.
364	TRUMP	I don't wanna pledge.
365	TRUMP	Why should I pledge to you?
366	TRUMP	If I pledge, I'll pledge.
367	TRUMP	I don't have to pledge to you.
368	TRUMP	But I have-
369	LESLEY STAHL	Well--
370	TRUMP	I have no intention of doing that.
371	TRUMP	Do you really think I'd call Russia to help me with an election?
372	TRUMP	Give me a break.
373	TRUMP	They wouldn't be able to help me at all.
374	TRUMP	Call Russia.
375	TRUMP	It's so ridiculous.
376	LESLEY STAHL	So you've been president for almost two years.
377	LESLEY STAHL	Is there anything that you wish you hadn't said, anything you wish you hadn't done?
378	LESLEY STAHL	Do you have any regrets?
379	TRUMP	So when I won the presidency, I th-- I-- I-- the press treats me terribly.
380	TRUMP	I thought very strongly that, you know, the one great thing will happen is the press will start treating me great.
381	TRUMP	Lesley, they treat me worse.
382	TRUMP	They got worse instead of better.
383	TRUMP	Very dishonest.
384	LESLEY STAHL	Okay, this-- you're-- but you regret?
385	TRUMP	I regret that the press treats me so badly--
386	LESLEY STAHL	I'm-- I'm really asking (Inaudible.)--
387	TRUMP	And despite that, my poll numbers are very good, so.
388	LESLEY STAHL	Have you made any mistakes?
389	LESLEY STAHL	That's my question.
390	TRUMP	Everybody makes mistakes.
391	LESLEY STAHL	And what have been yours?
392	TRUMP	I could have been-- earlier with terminating the NAFTA deal.
393	TRUMP	The problem was, I was getting to know the leaders.
394	TRUMP	I was getting to know countries.
395	TRUMP	I didn't wanna do it right outta the box.
396	TRUMP	So I waited a little while, but I could have done trade a little bit earlier.
397	LESLEY STAHL	What about the forced separation of children from their-- migrant children--
398	TRUMP	Yeah.
399	TRUMP	Well, that was--
400	LESLEY STAHL	from the--
401	TRUMP	the same as the Obama law.
402	TRUMP	You know, Obama had the same thing.
403	LESLEY STAHL	It was on the books, but he didn't enforce it.
404	LESLEY STAHL	You--enforced it.
405	LESLEY STAHL	You launched that-- the zero tolerance policy-- to deter families with children coming--
406	TRUMP	No, but then everybody decided and the courts don't want separation.
407	TRUMP	And frankly, when you don't do separa-- when you allow the parents to stay together, okay, when you allow that, then what happens is people are gonna pour into our country.
408	LESLEY STAHL	So are you gonna go back to that?
409	TRUMP	Well, we're looking at a lot of things.
410	TRUMP	Really what we wanna do is change the immigration laws, 'cause they were-- they were a laughing stock all over the world.
411	LESLEY STAHL	Are you willing though-- I think that you're saying you're-- it's under consideration.
412	TRUMP	No, I want all the laws changed.
413	LESLEY STAHL	But the children specifically--
414	TRUMP	there have to be consequences, Lesley, for coming into our country illegally.
415	TRUMP	And part of the r-- I mean, part of the reason, I have to blame myself, the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United States.
416	LESLEY STAHL	Can I just ask this simple question, yes or no.
417	TRUMP	Go ahead.
418	LESLEY STAHL	Are you willing to reinstitute that policy?
419	LESLEY STAHL	You said, "We're looking at everything."
420	TRUMP	I will--
421	LESLEY STAHL	Yes or no.
422	TRUMP	I will only-- I can't-- you can't say yes or no.
423	TRUMP	What I can say is this: There are consequences from coming into a country, namely our country, illegally.
424	LESLEY STAHL	I'm not gonna ask it again--
425	TRUMP	You don't have to.
426	LESLEY STAHL	cause I know you won't-- it--
427	TRUMP	But it's the same as Obama.
428	LESLEY STAHL	Okay.
429	LESLEY STAHL	Changing subjects again-- you are the first president of the United States who never had a political post before, nor never served in the military.
430	LESLEY STAHL	You come up here, you've been here for almost two years, what's the biggest surprise and what have you learned since you've been president?
431	TRUMP	Okay.
432	TRUMP	So I always used to say the toughest people are Manhattan real estate guys and blah, blah.
433	TRUMP	Now I say they're babies.
434	LESLEY STAHL	Who's the toughest?
435	TRUMP	They're babies, the political people.
436	TRUMP	This is the most deceptive, vicious world.
437	TRUMP	It is vicious, it's full of lies, deceit and deception.
438	TRUMP	You make a deal with somebody and it's like making a deal with-- that table.
439	LESLEY STAHL	Give me an example.
440	TRUMP	Well, I don't wanna give you an example.
441	TRUMP	I'm not lookin' to-- in the meantime, nobody's been able to do what I've been able to do.
442	TRUMP	Remember that.
443	TRUMP	When you look at taxes, you look at regulations, you look at-- making deals with other countries.
444	TRUMP	Nobody's been able to do anything like this.
445	TRUMP	Actually, most people didn't even try because they knew they didn't have the ability to do it.
446	TRUMP	But it's a very deceptive world.
447	TRUMP	The other thing I've really learned is I never knew how dishonest the media was.
448	TRUMP	I-- I-- and I really mean it.
449	TRUMP	I'm not saying that as a sound bite.
450	TRUMP	I never--
451	LESLEY STAHL	I'd like to--
452	TRUMP	Knew how dishonest--
453	LESLEY STAHL	I'm-- I'm gonna change the subject again.
454	TRUMP	Well, no, even the way you asked me a question, like, about separation.
455	TRUMP	When I say Obama did it, you don't wanna talk about it.
456	LESLEY STAHL	No, I'm gonna run your--
457	TRUMP	When I say I did it, let's make a big deal of it.
458	LESLEY STAHL	I'm gonna run your answer, but you did it four times, so.
459	TRUMP	I'm just telling you that you treated me much differently on the subject.
460	LESLEY STAHL	I disagree, but I don't wanna have that fight with you.
461	TRUMP	Hey, it's okay--
462	LESLEY STAHL	All right, I'll get in another fight with you--
463	TRUMP	Lesley, it's okay.
464	TRUMP	In the meantime, I'm president--and you're not.
465	LESLEY STAHL	This country is divided, polarized.
466	LESLEY STAHL	Within families, there aren't even people who can talk to each other.
467	LESLEY STAHL	What does this say about where we are as a country right now, all this division and strife and--
468	TRUMP	Yeah-- I think that--
469	LESLEY STAHL	--anger?
470	TRUMP	--what's going to happen-- I think the economy's bringing people together.
471	TRUMP	It was very polarized under President Obama, unbelievably polarized under President Obama.
472	TRUMP	I can see the country uniting.
473	TRUMP	I can see it.
474	TRUMP	We have people, Democrats, who behaved horribly during the Judge Kavanaugh-- you-- know what I'm saying.
475	LESLEY STAHL	But when you won that.
476	TRUMP	--during the hearings for the Supreme Court, we had senators that behaved horribly.
477	LESLEY STAHL	But when you won, you won.
478	LESLEY STAHL	No-- no one is gonna argue with that.
479	TRUMP	I won--
480	LESLEY STAHL	You won.
481	LESLEY STAHL	And then after you won, instead of saying, "Oh, let's all come together, this is wonderful.
482	LESLEY STAHL	Let's heal all of this," you come out and bash the Democrats.
483	TRUMP	Well, I bashed their attitude.
484	TRUMP	I bashed their statements--
485	LESLEY STAHL	But why not try to--
486	TRUMP	Because they were--
487	LESLEY STAHL	--bring us together?
488	TRUMP	--so unfair to Judge Kavanaugh.
489	TRUMP	I've never--
490	LESLEY STAHL	But why not--
491	TRUMP	seen anything like it.
492	LESLEY STAHL	--why not try and-- we need to be healed.
493	LESLEY STAHL	We need--
494	TRUMP	I don't think they want to heal yet, I'll be honest.
495	LESLEY STAHL	Well, you don't wanna--
496	TRUMP	I think--
497	LESLEY STAHL	heal yet.
498	TRUMP	I-- I-- I saw Hillary Clinton made a really nasty statement.
499	TRUMP	I don't think they wanna be healed.
500	TRUMP	I do wanna heal.
501	LESLEY STAHL	I'm n-- I'm not talking about Democrat-- I'm talking about the country.
502	LESLEY STAHL	You go out and you go to Mississippi.
503	TRUMP	The famous Mississippi speech?
504	LESLEY STAHL	And you mimicked Professor Blasey Ford.
505	LESLEY STAHL	You mimicked her.
506	TRUMP	Had I not made that speech, we would not have won.
507	TRUMP	I was just saying she didn't seem to know anything.
508	LESLEY STAHL	No (Inaudible.)--
509	TRUMP	And you're trying to destroy a life of a man who has been extraordinary.
510	LESLEY STAHL	Why did you have to make fun of her?
511	TRUMP	I didn't really make fun of her.
512	LESLEY STAHL	Well, they were laughing.
513	TRUMP	What I said the person that we're talking about didn't know the year, the time, the place.
514	LESLEY STAHL	Professor Blasey Ford got before the Senate and-- and was asked what's the worst moment.
515	LESLEY STAHL	And she said, "When the two boys laughed at me, at my expense."
516	TRUMP	Ok, fine.
517	LESLEY STAHL	And then I watched you mimic her and thousands of people were laughing at her.
518	TRUMP	They can do what they-- I-- I will tell you this.
519	TRUMP	The way now Justice Kavanaugh was treated has become a big factor in the midterms.
520	TRUMP	Have you seen what's gone on with the polls?
521	LESLEY STAHL	But did you have to--
522	TRUMP	Well, I think she was treated with great respect, I'll-- I'll--
523	LESLEY STAHL	And-- but--
524	TRUMP	be honest with you.
525	LESLEY STAHL	but do you think—you treated her with--
526	TRUMP	There are those that think she shouldn't have--
527	LESLEY STAHL	Do you think you treated her with respect?
528	TRUMP	I think so, yeah.
529	TRUMP	I did.
530	LESLEY STAHL	But you seem to be saying that she lied.
531	TRUMP	W-- you know what?
532	TRUMP	I'm not gonna get into it because we won.
533	TRUMP	It doesn't matter.
534	TRUMP	We won.
535	LESLEY STAHL	The anonymous column that ran in "The New York Times."
536	LESLEY STAHL	The author, we don't know who it is.
537	LESLEY STAHL	Whoever it is.
538	TRUMP	Whoever it is.
539	TRUMP	Maybe it was "The New York Times" too.
540	LESLEY STAHL	Paints a picture.
541	TRUMP	No, no, it's --By the way, you don't know how dishonest "The New York Times" is.
542	TRUMP	It could've been "The New York Times."
543	TRUMP	I doubt it.
544	TRUMP	But it could've been.
545	LESLEY STAHL	Okay.
546	LESLEY STAHL	I doubt it too.
547	TRUMP	It also could've been any-- w-- well, don't count on it.
548	TRUMP	It also could've been any one of 3,000 people.
549	LESLEY STAHL	You have said that this administration is like a smooth-running machine.
550	LESLEY STAHL	And yet, we keep hearing that the White House is in chaos.
551	TRUMP	It's-- wrong, it's so false.
552	TRUMP	It's fake news.
553	TRUMP	I'm changing things around.
554	TRUMP	And I'm entitled to.
555	TRUMP	I have people now on standby that will be phenomenal.
556	TRUMP	They'll come into the administration, they'll be phenomenal.
557	LESLEY STAHL	More people gonna go?
558	TRUMP	Yeah, other people will go, sure.
559	LESLEY STAHL	Cause so many people, you have kind of a record of --on turnover.
560	TRUMP	I think I have a great Cabinet.
561	TRUMP	There're some people that I'm not happy with.
562	LESLEY STAHL	Who are you not happy with?
563	TRUMP	No, I don't wanna say that but
564	LESLEY STAHL	Come on.
565	TRUMP	Not I don't want to say that.
566	LESLEY STAHL	What about General Mattis?
567	LESLEY STAHL	Is he going to leave?
568	TRUMP	Well, I don't know.
569	TRUMP	He hasn't told me that.
570	TRUMP	I have--
571	LESLEY STAHL	Do you want him to--
572	TRUMP	--a very good relationship with him.
573	TRUMP	It could be that he is.
574	TRUMP	I think he's sort of a Democrat, if you wanna know the truth.
575	TRUMP	But General Mattis is a good guy.
576	TRUMP	We get along very well.
577	TRUMP	He may leave.
578	TRUMP	I mean, at some point, everybody leaves.
579	TRUMP	Everybody.
580	TRUMP	People leave.
581	TRUMP	That's Washington.
582	LESLEY STAHL	The first lady, Melania.
583	LESLEY STAHL	She said that there are still people in the White House that she doesn't trust and that you shouldn't trust.
584	TRUMP	I feel the same way.
585	TRUMP	I don't trust everybody in the White House, I'll be honest with you.
586	LESLEY STAHL	You go to a meeting, do you have to wonder, "Is he wearing a wire--"
587	TRUMP	I'm usually --
588	LESLEY STAHL	–or whatever?
589	TRUMP	Not so much a wire.
590	TRUMP	I'm usually guarded.
591	TRUMP	And I think I'm guarded anyway.
592	TRUMP	But I'm not saying I trust everybody in the White House.
593	TRUMP	I'm not a baby.
594	TRUMP	It's a tough business.
595	TRUMP	This is a r-- this is a vicious place.
596	TRUMP	Washington DC is a vicious, vicious place.
597	TRUMP	The attacks, the-- the bad mouthing, the speaking behind your back.
598	TRUMP	--but-- you know, and in my way, I feel very comfortable here.
599	LESLEY STAHL	It takes a president a while to find his sea legs.
600	TRUMP	I think so.
601	TRUMP	I mean, I felt comfortable at the beginning, other than it was a little surreal to say I'm the president of the United States, but I think that's true with everybody.
602	LESLEY STAHL	POTUS.
603	TRUMP	Now I very much feel like POTUS.
604	TRUMP	I do.
605	TRUMP	I feel like the president.
606	TRUMP	You know, for a little while, it's like-- "Mr. President, sir."
607	TRUMP	It's-- even my friends, they call me, they-- they don't call me Donald-- they call me Mr. President.
608	TRUMP	And I say, "Will you please loosen up?"
609	TRUMP	I've learned on the job.
610	TRUMP	I have.
611	LESLEY STAHL	And you feel comfortable?
612	TRUMP	I feel very comfortable, yeah.
