1	TRUMP	Thank you very much, everybody.
2	TRUMP	Before we begin, I'd like to just say that we have a large team of very talented people in China.
3	TRUMP	We've had a negotiation going on for about two days.
4	TRUMP	It's going extremely well.
5	TRUMP	Who knows what that means, because it only matters if we get it done.
6	TRUMP	But we're very much working very closely with China and President Xi, who I respect a lot.
7	TRUMP	Very good relationship that we have.
8	TRUMP	And we're a lot closer than we ever were in this country with having a real trade deal.
9	TRUMP	We're covering everything — all of the points that people have been talking about for years that said couldn't be done, whether it was theft or anything.
10	TRUMP	Anything.
11	TRUMP	The unfairness.
12	TRUMP	We've been losing, on average, $375 billion a year with China.
13	TRUMP	A lot of people think it's $506 billion.
14	TRUMP	Some people think it's much more than that.
15	TRUMP	We're going to be leveling the playing field.
16	TRUMP	The tariffs are hurting China very badly.
17	TRUMP	They don't want them.
18	TRUMP	And frankly, if we can make the deal, it'd be my honor to remove them.
19	TRUMP	But otherwise, we're having many billions of dollars pouring into our Treasury.
20	TRUMP	We've never had that before with China.
21	TRUMP	It's been very much of a one-way street.
22	TRUMP	So, that's happening.
23	TRUMP	And the relationship with China is very good, but I think they finally respect our country.
24	TRUMP	They haven't respected us for a long time.
25	TRUMP	Not for a long time.
26	TRUMP	The UK and the U.S., as you probably have been seeing and hearing, we're agreeing to go forward and preserve our trade agreement.
27	TRUMP	You know all of the situation with respect to Brexit, and the complexity and the problems.
28	TRUMP	But we have a very good trading relationship with the UK, and that's just been strengthened further.
29	TRUMP	So with the UK, we're continuing our trade, and we are going to actually be increasing it very substantially as time goes by.
30	TRUMP	We expect that the UK will be very, very substantially increased as it relates to trade with the United States.
31	TRUMP	The relationship there, also, is very good.
32	TRUMP	We have a lot of great announcements having to do with Syria and our success with the eradication of the caliphate.
33	TRUMP	And that will be announced over the next 24 hours.
34	TRUMP	And many other things.
35	TRUMP	A lot of positive things are going on.
36	TRUMP	We're working on a summit.
37	TRUMP	And you know all about the summit.
38	TRUMP	It will be in Vietnam — Hanoi.
39	TRUMP	And we will — we'll be meeting in Hanoi.
40	TRUMP	We'll be meeting in Hanoi.
41	TRUMP	I think a lot of you will be going, I suspect.
42	TRUMP	And I hope we have the same good luck as we had in the first summit.
43	TRUMP	A lot was done in the first summit.
44	TRUMP	No more rockets going up.
45	TRUMP	No more missiles going up.
46	TRUMP	No more testing of nuclear.
47	TRUMP	Get back our remains, the remains of our great heroes from the Korean War.
48	TRUMP	And we got back our hostages.
49	TRUMP	But we hope we're going to be very much equally as successful.
50	TRUMP	I'm in no rush for speed.
51	TRUMP	We just don't want testing.
52	TRUMP	The sanctions, as you know, remain.
53	TRUMP	Everything is remaining.
54	TRUMP	China has been helping us, and Russia has been helping us.
55	TRUMP	And South Korea, I think you can say, has been — we've been working very closely with South Korea, with Japan.
56	TRUMP	But China, Russia, on the border, have really been at least partially living up to what they're supposed to be doing.
57	TRUMP	And that's okay — as per the United Nations.
58	TRUMP	So we will have a meeting on the 27th and 28th of February, and I think that will be a very successful one.
59	TRUMP	I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim.
60	TRUMP	We have also established a very good relationship, which has never happened between him or his family and the United States.
61	TRUMP	They have really taken advantage of the United States.
62	TRUMP	Billions of dollars has been paid to them.
63	TRUMP	And we won't let that happen.
64	TRUMP	But we think that North Korea and Chairman Kim have a tremendous potential as an economic force, economic power.
65	TRUMP	Their location between South Korea and then Russia and China — right smack in the middle — is phenomenal.
66	TRUMP	And we think that they have a great chance for tremendous economic prosperity in the future.
67	TRUMP	So I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim in Vietnam.
68	TRUMP	Today, I'm announcing several critical actions that my administration has taken to confront a problem that we have right here at home.
69	TRUMP	We fight wars that are 6,000 miles away; wars that we should have never been in, in many cases.
70	TRUMP	But we don't control our own border.
71	TRUMP	So we're going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border.
72	TRUMP	And we're going to do it one way or the other — we have to do it — not because it was a campaign promise, which it is.
73	TRUMP	It was one of many, by the way; not my only one.
74	TRUMP	We're rebuilding the military, our economy is thriving like never before.
75	TRUMP	You look at other economies — they're doing terribly, and we're doing phenomenally.
76	TRUMP	The market is up tremendously today, not that that's anything, but, you know — because I'll go back in and they'll say, "Oh, the market just went down."
77	TRUMP	But the market is getting close to the new highs that we created.
78	TRUMP	We have all the records.
79	TRUMP	We have every record.
80	TRUMP	But we're getting close to that point again where we'll create new records.
81	TRUMP	So our country is doing very well, economically.
82	TRUMP	And we've done a lot.
83	TRUMP	But one of the things I said I have to do and I want to do is border security, because we have tremendous amounts of drugs flowing into our country, much of it coming from the southern border.
84	TRUMP	When you look and when you listen to politicians — in particular, certain Democrats — they say it all comes through the port of entry.
85	TRUMP	It's wrong.
86	TRUMP	It's wrong.
87	TRUMP	It's just a lie.
88	TRUMP	It's all a lie.
89	TRUMP	They say walls don't work.
90	TRUMP	Walls work 100 percent.
91	TRUMP	Whether it's El Paso — I really was smiling, because the other night I was in El Paso — we had a tremendous crowd, and — tremendous crowd.
92	TRUMP	And I asked the people — many of whom were from El Paso, but they came from all over Texas.
93	TRUMP	And I asked them.
94	TRUMP	I said, "Let me ask you, as a crowd: When the wall went up, was it better?"
95	TRUMP	You were there, some of you.
96	TRUMP	It was not only better; it was like 100 percent better.
97	TRUMP	You know what they did.
98	TRUMP	But that's only one example.
99	TRUMP	There are so many examples.
100	TRUMP	In El Paso, they have close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall.
101	TRUMP	And they had 23 murders.
102	TRUMP	It's a lot of murders, but it's not close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall, in Mexico.
103	TRUMP	So everyone knows that walls work.
104	TRUMP	And there are better examples than El Paso, frankly.
105	TRUMP	You just take a look.
106	TRUMP	Almost everywhere.
107	TRUMP	Take a look at Israel.
108	TRUMP	They're building another wall.
109	TRUMP	Their wall is 99.9 percent effective, they told me — 99.9 percent.
110	TRUMP	That's what it would be with us, too.
111	TRUMP	The only weakness is they go to a wall and then they go around the wall.
112	TRUMP	They go around the wall and in.
113	TRUMP	Okay?
114	TRUMP	That's what it is.
115	TRUMP	It's very simple.
116	TRUMP	And a big majority of the big drugs — the big drug loads — don't go through ports of entry.
117	TRUMP	They can't go through ports of entry.
118	TRUMP	You can't take big loads because you have people — we have some very capable people; the Border Patrol, law enforcement — looking.
119	TRUMP	You can't take human traffic — women and girls — you can't take them through ports of entry.
120	TRUMP	You can't have them tied up in the backseat of a car or a truck or a van.
121	TRUMP	They open the door.
122	TRUMP	They look.
123	TRUMP	They can't see three women with tape on their mouth or three women whose hands are tied.
124	TRUMP	They go through areas where you have no wall.
125	TRUMP	Everybody knows that.
126	TRUMP	Nancy knows it.
127	TRUMP	Chuck knows it.
128	TRUMP	They all know it.
129	TRUMP	It's all a big lie.
130	TRUMP	It's a big con game.
131	TRUMP	You don't have to be very smart to know: You put up a barrier, the people come in, and that's it.
132	TRUMP	They can't do anything unless they walk left or right, and they find an area where there's no barrier, and they come into the United States.
133	TRUMP	Welcome.
134	TRUMP	We've detained more people.
135	TRUMP	Our border agents are doing such incredible work.
136	TRUMP	Our military has been incredible.
137	TRUMP	We put up barbed wire on top of certain old walls that were there.
138	TRUMP	We fixed the wall and we loaded it up with barbed wire.
139	TRUMP	It's very successful.
140	TRUMP	But our military has been fantastic, and I want to thank them.
141	TRUMP	And it's very necessary.
142	TRUMP	We've broken up two caravans that are on their way.
143	TRUMP	They just are breaking.
144	TRUMP	They're in the process of breaking up.
145	TRUMP	We have another one that we haven't been able to break up yet.
146	TRUMP	We've been actually working with Mexico much better than ever before.
147	TRUMP	I want to thank the President.
148	TRUMP	I want to thank Mexico.
149	TRUMP	They have their own problems.
150	TRUMP	They have the largest number of murders that they've ever had in their history — almost 40,000 murders.
151	TRUMP	Forty thousand.
152	TRUMP	And they got to straighten that out, and I think they will.
153	TRUMP	But I just want to thank the President, because he's been helping us with these monstrous caravans that have been coming up.
154	TRUMP	We had one that it was up to over 15,000 people.
155	TRUMP	It's largely broken up.
156	TRUMP	Others have gotten through.
157	TRUMP	And, in Tijuana, you have a lot of people staying there.
158	TRUMP	If we didn't have the wall up, and if we didn't have the wall secured and strengthened, they would have walked right through; they'd be welcomed to the United States.
159	TRUMP	One of the things we'd save tremendous — just a tremendous amount on would be sending the military.
160	TRUMP	If we had a wall, we don't need the military because we'd have a wall.
161	TRUMP	So I'm going to be signing a national emergency.
162	TRUMP	And it's been signed many times before.
163	TRUMP	It's been signed by other Presidents from 1977 or so.
164	TRUMP	It gave the Presidents the power.
165	TRUMP	There's rarely been a problem.
166	TRUMP	They sign it; nobody cares.
167	TRUMP	I guess they weren't very exciting.
168	TRUMP	But nobody cares.
169	TRUMP	They sign it for far less important things, in some cases, in many cases.
170	TRUMP	We're talking about an invasion of our country with drugs, with human traffickers, with all types of criminals and gangs.
171	TRUMP	We have some of the greatest people I know.
172	TRUMP	They've been with me from the beginning of my campaign — almost from the first week.
173	TRUMP	The Angel Moms.
174	TRUMP	Unfortunately, we have new Angel Moms.
175	TRUMP	One incredible woman just showed me her daughter who — we're talking about killed, in the year of '18.
176	TRUMP	I said, "I haven't seen you before."
177	TRUMP	She said, "No, I'm new."
178	TRUMP	I said, "That's too bad."
179	TRUMP	It's too bad.
180	TRUMP	It's so sad.
181	TRUMP	Stand up, just for a second.
182	TRUMP	Show how beautiful your girl was.
183	TRUMP	Thank you.
184	TRUMP	I have such respect for these people.
185	TRUMP	Angel Moms, Angel Dads, Angel Families.
186	TRUMP	I have great respect for these people.
187	TRUMP	These are great people.
188	TRUMP	These are great people.
189	TRUMP	They're fighting for their children that have been killed by people that were illegally in this country.
190	TRUMP	And the press doesn't cover them; they don't want to, incredibly.
191	TRUMP	And they're not treated the way they should be.
192	TRUMP	They're fighting for other people because they don't want what happened to their children or husband or anybody.
193	TRUMP	We have one young lady whose husband — please, stand up.
194	TRUMP	Your husband was just killed in Maryland.
195	TRUMP	Incredible man.
196	TRUMP	Just killed.
197	TRUMP	Beautiful children — won't be seeing their father again.
198	TRUMP	These are brave people.
199	TRUMP	These are people that — they don't have to be here.
200	TRUMP	They don't have to be doing this.
201	TRUMP	They're doing it for other people.
202	TRUMP	So I just want to thank all of you for being here, okay?
203	TRUMP	I really do.
204	TRUMP	I want to thank you.
205	TRUMP	Incredible people.
206	TRUMP	Last year, 70,000 Americans were killed, at least — I think the number is ridiculously low — by drugs, including meth and heroin and cocaine, fentanyl.
207	TRUMP	And one of the things that I did with President Xi in China, when I met him in Argentina at a summit — before I even started talking about the trade — it was a trade meeting.
208	TRUMP	It went very well, but before I talked about trade, I talked about something more important.
209	TRUMP	I said, "Listen, we have tremendous amounts of fentanyl coming into our country. It kills tens of thousands of people — I think far more than anybody registers. And I'd love you to declare it a lethal drug and put it on your criminal list."
210	TRUMP	And their criminal list is much tougher than our criminal list.
211	TRUMP	Their criminal list — a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty.
212	TRUMP	Our criminal list, a drug dealer gets a thing called, "How about a fine?"
213	TRUMP	And when I asked President Xi, I said, "Do you have a drug problem?"
214	TRUMP	"No, no, no." I said, "You have 1.4 billion people. What do you mean you have no drug problem?"
215	TRUMP	"No, we don't have a drug problem."  I said, "Why?" "Death penalty. We give death penalty to people that sell drugs."
216	TRUMP	End of problem.
217	TRUMP	What do we do?
218	TRUMP	We set up blue ribbon committees.
219	TRUMP	Lovely men and women — they sit around a table, they have lunch, they eat, they dine, and they waste a lot of time.
220	TRUMP	So if we want to get smart, we can get smart.
221	TRUMP	You can end the drug problem.
222	TRUMP	You can end it a lot faster than you think.
223	TRUMP	But President Xi has agreed to put fentanyl on his list of deadly, deadly drugs.
224	TRUMP	And it's a criminal penalty.
225	TRUMP	And the penalty is death.
226	TRUMP	So that's, frankly, one of the things I'm most excited about in our trade deal, if you want to know the truth.
227	TRUMP	I think maybe there's no more important point.
228	TRUMP	We're going to make billions of dollars with this trade deal.
229	TRUMP	It's going to be great for our country and great for China, I hope.
230	TRUMP	Their market is down close to 40 percent.
231	TRUMP	Our market is way up.
232	TRUMP	We've picked up, since my election, trillions of dollars of worth.
233	TRUMP	Trillions.
234	TRUMP	Many trillions.
235	TRUMP	And China has lost trillions of dollars.
236	TRUMP	But I want it to be good for China and I want it to be good for the United States.
237	TRUMP	So we'll see what happens.
238	TRUMP	China is coming here next week, by the way.
239	TRUMP	They're coming home, the traders.
240	TRUMP	And then China is coming here next week.
241	TRUMP	And then I'll be meeting with President Xi at some point after that to maybe — for some remaining deals.
242	TRUMP	We'll make them directly, one-on-one, ourselves.
243	TRUMP	So, we're going to be signing today, and registering, national emergency.
244	TRUMP	And it's a great thing to do because we have an invasion of drugs, invasion of gangs, invasion of people, and it's unacceptable.
245	TRUMP	And by signing the national emergency — something signed many times by other Presidents — many, many times.
246	TRUMP	President Obama — in fact, we may be using one of the national emergencies that he signed, having to do with cartels.
247	TRUMP	Criminal cartels.
248	TRUMP	It's a very good emergency that he signed.
249	TRUMP	And we're going to use parts of it in our dealings on cartels.
250	TRUMP	So that would be a second national emergency.
251	TRUMP	But, in that case, it's already in place.
252	TRUMP	And what we want — really want to do — is simple.
253	TRUMP	It's not like it's complicated.
254	TRUMP	It's very simple: We want to stop drugs from coming into our country.
255	TRUMP	We want to stop criminals and gangs from coming into our country.
256	TRUMP	Nobody has done the job that we've ever done.
257	TRUMP	I mean, nobody has done the job that we've done on the border.
258	TRUMP	And in a way, what I did by creating such a great economy — and if the opposing party got in, this economy would be down the tubes.
259	TRUMP	You know, I hear a lot of people say, "Oh, well. But maybe the previous administration…"
260	TRUMP	Let me tell you, the previous administration, it was heading south, and it was going fast.
261	TRUMP	We would have been down the tubes.
262	TRUMP	The regulations were strangling our country.
263	TRUMP	Unnecessary regulations.
264	TRUMP	By creating such a strong economy — you just look at your televisions or see what's going on today; it's through the roof.
265	TRUMP	What happens is more people want to come, so we have far more people trying to get into our country today than probably we've ever had before.
266	TRUMP	And we've done an incredible job in stopping them, but it's a massive number of people.
267	TRUMP	If we had the wall, it would be very easy.
268	TRUMP	We would make up for the cost of the wall just in the cost of the fact that I would be able to have fewer people.
269	TRUMP	We wouldn't need all of this incredible talent, some of whom are sitting in the first row.
270	TRUMP	You wouldn't need all of this incredible talent.
271	TRUMP	We would get — we would get thousands of law enforcement people, including Border Patrol.
272	TRUMP	You put them in different areas, you have them doing different things.
273	TRUMP	Law enforcement and Border Patrol.
274	TRUMP	And I want to thank law enforcement, and I want to thank Border Patrol, and I want to thank ICE.
275	TRUMP	ICE is abused by the press and by the Democrats.
276	TRUMP	And, by the way, we're going to be taking care of ICE.
277	TRUMP	You know, we talk about the new bill.
278	TRUMP	We're going to be taking care of ICE.
279	TRUMP	They wanted to get rid of ICE.
280	TRUMP	And the bill is just the opposite of that.
281	TRUMP	A lot of good things happened.
282	TRUMP	So, that's the story.
283	TRUMP	We want to have a safe country.
284	TRUMP	I ran on a very simple slogan: "Make America Great Again."
285	TRUMP	If you're going to have drugs pouring across the border, if you're going to have human traffickers pouring across the border in areas where we have no protection, in areas where we don't have a barrier, then very hard to make America great again.
286	TRUMP	But we've done a fantastic job, but we haven't been given the equipment.
287	TRUMP	We haven't been given the walls.
288	TRUMP	And in the bill, by the way, they didn't even fight us on most of the stuff.
289	TRUMP	Ports of entry.
290	TRUMP	We have so much money, we don't know what to do with it.
291	TRUMP	I don't know what to do with all the money they're giving us.
292	TRUMP	It's crazy.
293	TRUMP	The only place they don't want to give as much money — $1,375,000,000.
294	TRUMP	Sounds like a lot, but it's not so much, although we're putting it to much better use than it used to be.
295	TRUMP	A lot of the past administrations, they had — it was easy to get, and they didn't build or they didn't do what they could have done.
296	TRUMP	It would have been great.
297	TRUMP	It would have been great to have done it earlier, but I was a little new to the job, a little new to the profession.
298	TRUMP	And we had a little disappointment for the first year and a half.
299	TRUMP	People that should have stepped up did not step up.
300	TRUMP	They didn't step up, and they should have.
301	TRUMP	Would have been easy.
302	TRUMP	Not that easy, but it would have been a lot easier.
303	TRUMP	But some people didn't step up.
304	TRUMP	But we're stepping up now.
305	TRUMP	So we have a chance of getting close to $8 billion.
306	TRUMP	Whether it's $8 billion or $2 billion or $1.5 billion, it's going to build a lot of wall.
307	TRUMP	We're getting it done.
308	TRUMP	We're right now in construction with wall in some of the most important areas.
309	TRUMP	And we have renovated a tremendous amount of wall, making it just as good as new.
310	TRUMP	That's where a lot of the money has been spent — on renovation.
311	TRUMP	In fact, we were restricted to renovating, which is okay.
312	TRUMP	But we're going to run out of areas that we can renovate pretty soon.
313	TRUMP	So — and we need new wall.
314	TRUMP	So I want to thank everybody for being here.
315	TRUMP	I want to thank, in particular, the Angel Moms and Dads for being here.
316	TRUMP	Thank you very much.
317	TRUMP	We have great respect for you.
318	TRUMP	The real country, our real country — the people that really love our country, they love you.
319	TRUMP	So I just want you to know that.
320	TRUMP	I know how hard you fight and I know how hard a fight you're having.
321	TRUMP	I also want to thank all of the law enforcement for the job you do.
322	TRUMP	Believe me, our country loves you and they respect you greatly.
323	TRUMP	And we're giving you a lot of surplus.
324	TRUMP	We're giving you surplus military equipment, which a lot of people didn't like giving, previous to this administration.
325	TRUMP	But hundreds of millions of dollars of surplus equipment.
326	TRUMP	And as we get it, as you know, we send it down.
327	TRUMP	And you have much better protection.
328	TRUMP	But I really appreciate you being here.
329	TRUMP	So the order is signed.
330	TRUMP	And I'll sign the final papers as soon as I get into the Oval Office.
331	TRUMP	And we will have a national emergency, and then we will then be sued, and they will sue us in the Ninth Circuit, even though it shouldn't be there.
332	TRUMP	And we will possibly get a bad ruling, and then we'll get another bad ruling.
333	TRUMP	And then we'll end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully we'll get a fair shake.
334	TRUMP	And we'll win in the Supreme Court, just like the ban.
335	TRUMP	They sued us in the Ninth Circuit, and we lost, and then we lost in the appellate division, and then we went to the Supreme Court, and we won.
336	TRUMP	And it was very interesting, because yesterday they were talking about the ban.
337	TRUMP	Because we have a ban.
338	TRUMP	It's very helpful.
339	TRUMP	Madam Secretary, is that right?
340	TRUMP	Without the ban, we'd have a bigger problem.
341	TRUMP	We have a ban on certain areas, certain countries, depending on what's going on in the world.
342	TRUMP	And we won.
343	TRUMP	But somebody said, "President Trump lost on the ban."
344	TRUMP	Well, he was right; I lost at the lower court.
345	TRUMP	He — he didn't say that we ultimately won at the United States Supreme Court.
346	TRUMP	They didn't want to say that.
347	TRUMP	They didn't want to go that far.
348	TRUMP	They were saying how I lost.
349	TRUMP	The person sitting right up here — "Donald Trump lost on the ban."
350	TRUMP	Yeah, I did.
351	TRUMP	And then I lost a second time; you should have said that, too.
352	TRUMP	And then it went to the Supreme Court and I won.
353	TRUMP	Didn't want to take it that far.
354	TRUMP	But we won on the ban and we won on other things, too.
355	TRUMP	The probably easiest one to win is on declaring a national emergency, because we're declaring it for virtual invasion purposes: drugs, traffickers, and gangs.
356	TRUMP	And one of the things, just to finish: We have removed thousands of MS-13 gang monsters.
357	TRUMP	Thousands.
358	TRUMP	They're out of this country.
359	TRUMP	We take them out by the thousands.
360	TRUMP	And they are monsters.
361	TRUMP	Okay.
362	TRUMP	Do you have any questions?
363	TRUMP	Yeah.
364	TRUMP	John, go ahead.
365	QUESTION	Mr. President — (inaudible).
366	QUESTION	AIDE:  Yes, we do.
367	QUESTION	There you go.
368	QUESTION	You were prepared.
369	QUESTION	Mr. President, a lot of the money —
370	TRUMP	Were you saying I was prepared?
371	QUESTION	With the microphone and prepared for questions.
372	TRUMP	Oh, I thought you meant I was prepared.
373	TRUMP	I couldn't believe you said that.
374	QUESTION	(LAUGHTER)
375	QUESTION	No, no, no.
376	QUESTION	(LAUGHTER)
377	TRUMP	People don't like saying that.
378	QUESTION	You were prepared for questions.
379	TRUMP	I am prepared.
380	TRUMP	I'm always prepared.
381	QUESTION	A lot of the money that goes to count toward your $8 billion is money that's being reprogrammed in the DOD budget.
382	QUESTION	How can you guarantee to military families and to our men and women of the military that none of the money that would be reprogrammed to a wall will take away from other technology, other renovations, construction that is desperately needed in our military?
383	TRUMP	Yeah.
384	TRUMP	So, John, we had certain funds that are being used at the discretion of generals, at the discretion of the military.
385	TRUMP	Some of them haven't been allocated yet, and some of the generals think that this is more important.
386	TRUMP	I was speaking to a couple of them.
387	TRUMP	They think this is far more important than what they were going to use it for.
388	TRUMP	I said, "What were you going to use it for?"
389	TRUMP	And I won't go into details, but it didn't sound too important to me.
390	TRUMP	Plus, if you think, I've gotten $700 billion for the military in year one, and then last year, $716 billion.
391	TRUMP	And we're rebuilding our military, but we have a lot.
392	TRUMP	And under the previous administration, our military was depleted — badly depleted.
393	TRUMP	And they weren't spending — I mean, they had a much less — they had a much smaller amount of money.
394	TRUMP	So when I got $700 billion, and then $716 billion — and this year, it's going to be pretty big too, because there's few things more important than our military.
395	TRUMP	You know, I'm a big deficit believer and all of that, but before we really start focusing on certain things, we have to build up our military.
396	TRUMP	It was very badly depleted.
397	TRUMP	And we're buying all new jetfighters, all new missiles, all new defensive equipment.
398	TRUMP	We have — we'll soon have a military like we've never had before.
399	TRUMP	But when you think about the kind of numbers you're talking about — so you have $700 billion, $716 billion — when I need $2 billion, $3 billion of out that for a wall — which is a very important instrument, very important for the military because of the drugs that pour in.
400	TRUMP	And as you know, we have specific rules and regulations where they have drugs, and what you can do in order to stop drugs.
401	TRUMP	And that's part of it, too.
402	TRUMP	We're taking a lot of money from that realm also.
403	TRUMP	But when you have that kind of money going into the military, this is a very, very small amount that we're asking for.
404	TRUMP	Yeah, go ahead.
405	TRUMP	Go ahead.
406	TRUMP	ABC.
407	TRUMP	Not NBC.
408	TRUMP	I like ABC a little bit more — not much.
409	TRUMP	Come on, ABC.
410	TRUMP	Not much.
411	TRUMP	Pretty close.
412	QUESTION	Mr. President, what do you say to those, including some of your Republican allies, who say that you are violating the Constitution with this move and setting a bad precedent that will be abused by possibly Democratic Presidents in the future?
413	QUESTION	Marco Rubio has made this point.
414	TRUMP	Well, not too many people.
415	TRUMP	Yeah.
416	TRUMP	Not too many people have said that.
417	TRUMP	But the courts will determine that.
418	TRUMP	Look, I expect to be sued.
419	TRUMP	I shouldn't be sued.
420	TRUMP	Very rarely do you get sued when you do national emergency.
421	TRUMP	And then other people say, "Oh, if you use it for this, now what are we using it for?"
422	TRUMP	We got to get rid of drugs and gangs and people.
423	TRUMP	It's an invasion.
424	TRUMP	We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country that we stop, but it's very hard to stop.
425	TRUMP	With a wall, it would be very easy.
426	TRUMP	So I think that we will be very successful in court.
427	TRUMP	I think it's clear.
428	TRUMP	And the people that say we create precedent — well, what do you have?
429	TRUMP	Fifty-six?
430	TRUMP	There are a lot of times — well, that's creating precedent.
431	TRUMP	And many of those are far less important than having a border.
432	TRUMP	If you don't have a border, you don't have a country.
433	TRUMP	You know, we fight — before I got here — we fight all over the world to create borders for countries, but we don't create a border for our own country.
434	TRUMP	So I think what will happen is, sadly, we'll be sued, and sadly, it'll go through a process.
435	TRUMP	And, happily, we'll win — I think.
436	TRUMP	Go ahead.
437	TRUMP	Let's go.
438	TRUMP	Let's hear it, NBC.
439	TRUMP	Come on.
440	QUESTION	Thank you, Mr. President.
441	QUESTION	I just want to say, in the past, when President Obama tried to use executive action as it related to immigration, you said, "The whole concept of executive order, it's not the way the country is supposed to be run."
442	QUESTION	You said, "You're supposed to go through Congress and make a deal."
443	QUESTION	Will you concede that you were unable to make the deal that you had promised in the past, and that the deal you're ending up with now from Congress is less than what you could have had before a 35-day shutdown?
444	TRUMP	No.
445	TRUMP	Look, I went through Congress.
446	TRUMP	I made a deal.
447	TRUMP	I got almost $1.4 billion when I wasn't supposed to get one dollar — not one dollar.
448	TRUMP	"He's not going to get one dollar."
449	TRUMP	Well, I got $1.4 billion.
450	TRUMP	But I'm not happy with it.
451	TRUMP	I also got billions and billions of dollars for other things — port of entries, lots of different things.
452	TRUMP	The purchase of drug equipment.
453	TRUMP	More than we were even requesting.
454	TRUMP	In fact, the primary fight was on the wall.
455	TRUMP	Everything else, we have so much, as I said, I don't know what to do with it we have so much money.
456	TRUMP	But on the wall, they skimped.
457	TRUMP	So I did — I was successful, in that sense, but I want to do it faster.
458	TRUMP	I could do the wall over a longer period of time.
459	TRUMP	I didn't need to do this.
460	TRUMP	But I'd rather do it much faster.
461	TRUMP	And I don't have to do it for the election.
462	TRUMP	I've already done a lot of wall, for the election — 2020.
463	TRUMP	And the only reason we're up here talking about this is because of the election, because they want to try and win an election, which it looks like they're not going to be able to do.
464	TRUMP	And this is one of the ways they think they can possibly win, is by obstruction and a lot of other nonsense.
465	TRUMP	And I think that I just want to get it done faster, that's all.
466	TRUMP	Okay.
467	TRUMP	Yes, ma'am, go ahead.
468	QUESTION	Thank you, Mr. President.
469	TRUMP	Thank you.
470	QUESTION	Roberta Rampton from Reuters.
471	QUESTION	I wanted to ask about China.
472	QUESTION	Do you feel that enough progress has been made in the talks to head off the increase in tariffs scheduled for March 1?
473	TRUMP	Well, you know, you're talking to the wrong person, because I happen to like tariffs, okay?
474	TRUMP	I mean, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China.
475	TRUMP	And our steel industry now, as an example, we tax dumped steel — much of it comes from China — at 25 percent.
476	TRUMP	Our steel industry is so vibrant now again, they're building plants all over the United States.
477	TRUMP	It's a beautiful thing.
478	TRUMP	And from a defensive standpoint, and from any standpoint, you need steel.
479	TRUMP	You know, you can do without certain industries.
480	TRUMP	Our country cannot do without steel.
481	TRUMP	So, I love tariffs, but I also love them to negotiate.
482	TRUMP	And right now, China is paying us billions of dollars a year in tariffs.
483	TRUMP	And I haven't even started.
484	TRUMP	Now, here's the thing: If we make a deal, they won't have to pay.
485	TRUMP	You know, it'll be a whole different story.
486	TRUMP	They won't be paying that, but we'll have a fair deal.
487	TRUMP	There won't be intellectual property theft.
488	TRUMP	There won't be so many other things that have gone on.
489	TRUMP	And no other President has done this.
490	TRUMP	No other — you know, we didn't have a deal with China.
491	TRUMP	You had the WTO, one of the worst trade deals ever made — probably even worse than NAFTA, if that's believable, which, you know, hard to believe, because I think NAFTA was just a disaster.
492	TRUMP	It was a total disaster for our country.
493	TRUMP	And now we made the USMCA, which is going to be a terrific — a great deal.
494	TRUMP	And, by the way, the USMCA, from Mexico — that's United States, Mexico, Canada — that's where the money is coming from, not directly but indirectly, for the wall.
495	TRUMP	And nobody wants to talk about that.
496	TRUMP	Because we're saving billions and billions of dollars a year, if Congress approves that deal.
497	TRUMP	Now, they might now want to approve a deal just because they'll say — one of the things I'm thinking of doing — this has never been done before: No matter how good a deal I make with China, if they sell me Beijing for one dollar, if they give me 50 percent of their land and every ship that they've built over the last two years — which is a lot — and they give them to me free, the Democrats will say, "What a lousy deal; that's a terrible deal."
498	TRUMP	Like, ZTE, I got a billion — more than a billion-dollar penalty in a short period of time.
499	TRUMP	And the Democrats said, "Oh, should've gotten more."
500	TRUMP	When I made that deal, I said, "This is incredible."
501	TRUMP	I just got — I got over a billion-dollar penalty, plus they had to change their board of directors.
502	TRUMP	They had to change their top management.
503	TRUMP	But they had to pay over a billion dollars.
504	TRUMP	I said, "What a deal."
505	TRUMP	It took like a week.
506	TRUMP	And the Democrats didn't even know there was a problem with ZTE.
507	TRUMP	I'm the one that find them.
508	TRUMP	I'm the one that settled it.
509	TRUMP	Over a billion dollars.
510	TRUMP	And President Xi called me and he said it would be important to him if they could get a deal.
511	TRUMP	And we made a deal — paid — like, in a short period of time.
512	TRUMP	The Democrats went out and said, "Oh, they should've done better."
513	TRUMP	So what I'm thinking of doing is getting Chuck Schumer, getting Nancy Pelosi, having them bring two or three of their brilliant representatives.
514	TRUMP	And we'll all go down together, and what we'll do is we'll negotiate.
515	TRUMP	I'll put them in the room and let them speak up.
516	TRUMP	Because any deal I make with China, if it's the great — it's going to be better than any deal that anybody ever dreamt possible, or I'm not going to have a deal.
517	TRUMP	It's a very simple.
518	TRUMP	But any deal I make with China, Schumer is going to stand up and say, "Oh, it should've been better. It should've been better." 
519	TRUMP	And you know what?
520	TRUMP	That's not acceptable to me.
521	TRUMP	So I'm thinking about doing something very different.
522	TRUMP	I don't think it's ever been — I just don't want to be second-guessed.
523	TRUMP	But that's not even second-guess; that's called politics.
524	TRUMP	Sadly, I'd probably do the same thing to them, okay?
525	TRUMP	But any deal I make toward the end, I'm going to bring Schumer — at least offer him — and Pelosi.
526	TRUMP	I'm going to say, "Please join me on the deal."
527	TRUMP	And, by the way, I just see our new Attorney General is sitting in the front row.
528	TRUMP	Please stand up, Bill.
529	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
530	TRUMP	Such an easy job he's got.
531	TRUMP	He's got the easiest job in government.
532	TRUMP	Thank you and congratulations.
533	TRUMP	That was a great vote yesterday.
534	TRUMP	Thank you very much.
535	QUESTION	Mr. President —
536	TRUMP	Yes, go ahead.
537	TRUMP	Go ahead.
538	QUESTION	In your remarks, sir, you said that you were too new to politics, earlier in your administration, when you would've preferred that this be done.
539	QUESTION	Is that an admission of how you might be changing on the job?
540	QUESTION	And —
541	TRUMP	Well, I'm learning.
542	TRUMP	I mean, I am learning.
543	TRUMP	Don't forget, it's not like I've done this for — a senator came into my office and said, "Sir, I've been running for office for 30 years. I've won seven out of seven. I did lose a couple when I was younger."
544	TRUMP	I said, "Well, I've won one out of one. But, you know, I never did politics before. Now I do politics."
545	TRUMP	I will tell you, I'm very disappointed at certain people, a particular one, for not having pushed this faster.
546	QUESTION	Are you referring to Speaker Ryan, sir?
547	TRUMP	But I've learned — who?
548	QUESTION	Speaker Ryan.
549	TRUMP	Let's not talk about it.
550	QUESTION	Okay.
551	TRUMP	What difference does it make?
552	TRUMP	But they should have pushed it faster.
553	TRUMP	They should have pushed it harder.
554	TRUMP	And they didn't.
555	TRUMP	They didn't.
556	TRUMP	If they would have, it would have been a little bit better.
557	TRUMP	In the meantime, I've built a lot of wall.
558	TRUMP	I have a lot of money, and I've built a lot of wall.
559	TRUMP	But it would've been nice to have gotten done.
560	TRUMP	And I would like to see major immigration reform, and maybe that's something we can all work on, Bill, where we all get together and do major immigration reform — not just for a wall, for a barrier; for port of entry, for other things.
561	TRUMP	We have a real problem.
562	TRUMP	We have catch-and-release.
563	TRUMP	You catch a criminal and you have to release them.
564	TRUMP	We have so many other things.
565	TRUMP	You have chain migration, where a bad person comes in, brings 22 or 23 or 35 of his family members — because he has his mother, his grandmother, his sister, his cousin, his uncle — they're all in.
566	TRUMP	You know what happened on the West Side Highway.
567	TRUMP	That young wise guy drove over and killed eight people and horribly injured — nobody talks about that — horribly — like, loss of legs and arms — going 60 miles an hour, he made a right turn into a park on the West Side Highway, along the Hudson River in New York.
568	TRUMP	He had many people brought in because he was in the United States.
569	TRUMP	It's called chain migration.
570	TRUMP	And then you have the lottery.
571	TRUMP	It's a horror show, because when countries put people into the lottery, they're not putting you in; they're putting some very bad people in the lottery.
572	TRUMP	It's common sense.
573	TRUMP	If I ran a country, and if I have a lottery system of people going to the United States, I'm not going to put in my stars; I'm going to put in people I don't want.
574	TRUMP	The lottery system is a disaster.
575	TRUMP	I'm stuck with it.
576	QUESTION	Mr. President, could you tell us —
577	TRUMP	It should have — wait.
578	TRUMP	It should have never happened.
579	TRUMP	Okay.
580	QUESTION	Mr. President, could you tell us to what degree some of the outside conservative voices helped to shape your views on this national emergency?
581	TRUMP	I would talk about it.
582	TRUMP	Look, Sean Hannity has been a terrific, terrific supporter of what I do.
583	TRUMP	Not of me.
584	TRUMP	If I changed my views, he wouldn't be with me.
585	TRUMP	Rush Limbaugh — I think he's a great guy.
586	TRUMP	Here's a guy who can speak for three hours without a phone call.
587	TRUMP	Try doing that sometime.
588	TRUMP	For three hours, he speaks.
589	TRUMP	He's got one of the biggest audiences in the history of the world.
590	TRUMP	I mean, this guy is unbelievable.
591	TRUMP	Try speaking for three hours without taking calls.
592	TRUMP	Taking calls is easy.
593	TRUMP	"Okay, I'll answer this one. I'll answer that one."
594	TRUMP	He goes for three hours, and he's got an audience that's fantastic.
595	QUESTION	Should they be —
596	TRUMP	Wait —
597	QUESTION	Should they be deciding policy, sir?
598	TRUMP	They don't decide policy.
599	TRUMP	In fact, if I went opposite — I mean, they have somebody — Ann Coulter.
600	TRUMP	I don't know her.
601	TRUMP	I hardly know her.
602	TRUMP	I haven't spoken to her in way over a year.
603	TRUMP	But the press loves saying "Ann Coulter."
604	TRUMP	Probably, if I did speak to her, she'd be very nice.
605	TRUMP	I just don't have the time to speak to her.
606	TRUMP	I would speak to her; I have nothing against her.
607	TRUMP	In fact, I like her for one reason: When they asked her, like right at the beginning, who was going to win the election, she said, "Donald Trump."
608	TRUMP	And the two people that asked her that question smiled.
609	TRUMP	They said, "You're kidding, aren't you?"
610	TRUMP	"Nope. Donald Trump."
611	TRUMP	So I like her, but she's off the reservation.
612	TRUMP	But anybody that knows her understands that.
613	TRUMP	But I haven't spoken to her.
614	TRUMP	I don't follow her.
615	TRUMP	I don't talk to her.
616	TRUMP	But the press loves to bring up the name "Ann Coulter."
617	TRUMP	And you know what?
618	TRUMP	I think she's fine.
619	TRUMP	I think she's good.
620	TRUMP	But I just don't speak to her.
621	TRUMP	Laura has been great.
622	TRUMP	Laura Ingraham.
623	TRUMP	Tucker Carlson has been great.
624	TRUMP	I actually have a couple people on CNN that have been very good.
625	TRUMP	I have some on MSNBC.
626	TRUMP	The other day, they did a great report of me.
627	TRUMP	I said, "Where the hell did that come from?"
628	TRUMP	I think it was the only one in over a year.
629	TRUMP	So the crazy thing is, I just had, as you know, Rasmussen — 52 percent in the polls.
630	TRUMP	It's my highest poll number.
631	TRUMP	And people get what we're doing.
632	TRUMP	They get it.
633	TRUMP	They really get it.
634	TRUMP	And I'm honored by it.
635	TRUMP	Yes.
636	TRUMP	Jim Acosta.
637	QUESTION	Thank you, Mr. President.
638	QUESTION	I wonder if you could comment on this disconnect that we seem to have in this country, where you are presenting information about what's happening at the border — calling it an "invasion," talking about women with duct tape over their mouths, and so on — and yet there's a lot of reporting out there, there's a lot of crime data out there, there's a lot of Department of Homeland Security data out there that shows border crossings at a near-record low —
639	TRUMP	That's because of us.
640	TRUMP	But it's still —
641	QUESTION	— that shows undocumented immigrants committing crime at lower levels —
642	TRUMP	Excuse me.
643	TRUMP	It's still massive numbers of crossings.
644	QUESTION	— that shows undocumented criminals — or undocumented immigrants committing crime at lower levels than native-born Americans.
645	QUESTION	What do you say —
646	TRUMP	You don't really believe that stat, do you?
647	TRUMP	Do you really believe that stat?
648	QUESTION	What do you — well, let me ask you this —
649	TRUMP	Take a look at our federal prisons.
650	QUESTION	I believe in facts and statistics and data, but —
651	TRUMP	Okay?
652	TRUMP	Any more?
653	TRUMP	Quick, let's go.
654	QUESTION	Let me just ask you this: What do you say to your critics who say that you are creating a national emergency, that you're concocting a national emergency here in order to get your wall because you couldn't get it through other ways?
655	TRUMP	I ask the Angel Moms: What do you think?
656	TRUMP	Do you think I'm creating something?
657	TRUMP	Ask these incredible women, who lost their daughters and their sons.
658	TRUMP	Okay?
659	QUESTION	This is real.
660	TRUMP	Because your question is a very political question because you have an agenda.
661	TRUMP	You're CNN.
662	TRUMP	You're fake news.
663	TRUMP	You have an agenda.
664	TRUMP	The numbers that you gave are wrong.
665	TRUMP	Take a look at our federal prison population.
666	TRUMP	See how many of them, percentage-wise, are illegal aliens.
667	TRUMP	Just see.
668	TRUMP	Go ahead and see.
669	TRUMP	It's a fake question.
670	TRUMP	Yes.
671	TRUMP	Go ahead.
672	QUESTION	Can I ask a follow-up?
673	QUESTION	Thank you, Mr. President.
674	QUESTION	Just to follow up on that, unifying crime reporting statistics — numbers from your own Border Patrol, numbers from this government — show that the amount of illegal immigrants are down, there is not violence on the border, and that most —
675	TRUMP	There's not violence on the border?
676	QUESTION	There's not as much violence as —
677	TRUMP	Oh, really?
678	QUESTION	Let me — wait a minute.
679	QUESTION	Wait a minute.
680	QUESTION	Wait —
681	TRUMP	You had 26 people killed —
682	QUESTION	Let me finish the question, please.
683	QUESTION	Let me finish the question, please.
684	TRUMP	Two weeks ago, 26 people were killed in a gunfight on the border —
685	QUESTION	I understand what you're — I understand what you're saying.
686	TRUMP	— a mile away from where I went.
687	QUESTION	I was there.
688	QUESTION	I understand.
689	QUESTION	That's not the question.
690	QUESTION	The question is —
691	TRUMP	Do we forget about that?
692	QUESTION	No, I'm not forgetting about it.
693	QUESTION	I'm asking you to clarify where you get your numbers, because most of the DEA crime reporting statistics that we see show that drugs are coming across at the ports of entry, that illegal immigration is down, and the violence is down.
694	TRUMP	Okay.
695	QUESTION	So what do you base your facts on?
696	TRUMP	Okay, let me — come on, let's go.
697	TRUMP	Sort of — sort of —
698	QUESTION	And, secondly —
699	TRUMP	No, no.
700	TRUMP	You get one.
701	TRUMP	You get one.
702	TRUMP	Ready?
703	QUESTION	Well, the second question is —
704	TRUMP	Just sit down.
705	TRUMP	Wait.
706	TRUMP	Sit down.
707	TRUMP	Sit down.
708	QUESTION	Could you please answer it?
709	TRUMP	Sit down.
710	TRUMP	You get one question.
711	TRUMP	I get my numbers from a lot of sources — like Homeland Security, primarily.
712	TRUMP	And the numbers that I have from Homeland Security are a disaster.
713	TRUMP	And you know what else is a disaster?
714	TRUMP	The numbers that come out of Homeland Security, Kirstjen, for the cost that we spend and the money that we lose because of illegal immigration: Billions and billions of dollars a month.
715	TRUMP	Billions and billions of dollars.
716	TRUMP	And it's unnecessary.
717	QUESTION	So your own government stats are wrong, are you saying?
718	TRUMP	No, no.
719	TRUMP	I use many stats.
720	TRUMP	I use many stats.
721	QUESTION	Could you share those stats with us?
722	TRUMP	Let me tell you, you have stats that are far worse than the ones that I use.
723	TRUMP	But I use many stats, but I also use Homeland Security.
724	TRUMP	All right, next question.
725	QUESTION	And do you — wait a minute.
726	QUESTION	Just a quick follow-up.
727	TRUMP	Go ahead.
728	TRUMP	No.
729	TRUMP	Go.
730	TRUMP	Please.
731	QUESTION	Thank you, Mr. President.
732	QUESTION	I just want to bring you back to China for a second.
733	QUESTION	The White House put out a statement today talking about the March 1st deadline.
734	QUESTION	The other day, though, you gave the possibility that maybe this could slide.
735	QUESTION	Are you eyeing a possible extension — 30 days, maybe 60 days?
736	QUESTION	What is the status there?
737	QUESTION	Or is March 1st the deadline?
738	TRUMP	Yeah.
739	TRUMP	Very good question.
740	TRUMP	So it's a very big deal.
741	TRUMP	I guess you could say it's like — must be the biggest deal ever made, if you think.
742	TRUMP	Trade with China, how big does that get?
743	TRUMP	Although if you look, the USCMA is right up there.
744	TRUMP	But it's very complicated.
745	TRUMP	There are many, many points that we're bringing up that nobody ever brought up or thought to bring up, but they're very important, because we were on the wrong side of every one of them.
746	TRUMP	There is a possibility that I will extend the date.
747	TRUMP	And if I do that, if I see that we're close to a deal or the deal is going in the right direction, I would do that at the same tariffs that we're charging now.
748	TRUMP	I would not increase the tariffs.
749	QUESTION	Let me also ask you about the debt, sir, because it's gone from a shade under $20 trillion from when you took office.
750	QUESTION	Now it's a shade over $22 trillion and heading in the wrong direction.
751	QUESTION	What are your plans to reverse it?
752	TRUMP	Well, it's all about growth.
753	TRUMP	But before I —
754	QUESTION	(Inaudible.)
755	TRUMP	— really focus on that — and you have to remember, President Obama put on more debt on this country than every President in the history of our country combined.
756	TRUMP	So when I took over, we had one man that put on more debt than every other President combined.
757	TRUMP	Combine them all.
758	TRUMP	So you can't be talking about that.
759	TRUMP	But I talk about it because I consider it very important.
760	TRUMP	But first, I have to straighten out the military.
761	TRUMP	The military was depleted.
762	TRUMP	And if we don't have a strong military — that hopefully we won't have to use because it's strong — if we don't have a strong military, you don't have to worry about debt; you have bigger problems.
763	TRUMP	So I have to straighten out the military.
764	TRUMP	That's why I did the $700- and $716 billion.
765	TRUMP	But growth will straighten it out.
766	TRUMP	You saw last month, the trade deficit went way down.
767	TRUMP	Everybody said, "What happened?"  Well, what's happening is growth.
768	TRUMP	But before I can focus too much on that, a very big expense is military.
769	TRUMP	And we have no choice but to straighten out our military.
770	QUESTION	Is growth the only answer, sir, or is (inaudible)?
771	TRUMP	Yes, ma'am, go ahead.
772	QUESTION	Thank you, Mr. President.
773	QUESTION	On North Korea — back on the last summit, you guys came out with a pretty general agreement.
774	TRUMP	Yes.
775	QUESTION	I was wondering what you thought has, you know, been accomplished since the last summit.
776	QUESTION	And then —
777	TRUMP	A lot.
778	QUESTION	— are we going to be seeing anything concrete —
779	TRUMP	A lot has been accomplished.
780	TRUMP	Okay.
781	QUESTION	— on denuclearization.
782	TRUMP	Yeah.
783	TRUMP	A lot has been accomplished.
784	TRUMP	We're dealing with them, we're talking to them.
785	TRUMP	When I came into office, I met right there, in the Oval Office, with President Obama.
786	TRUMP	And I sat in those beautiful chairs and we talked.
787	TRUMP	It was supposed to be 15 minutes.
788	TRUMP	As you know, it ended up being many times longer than that.
789	TRUMP	And I said, "What's the biggest problem?"
790	TRUMP	He said, "By far, North Korea."
791	TRUMP	And I don't want to speak for him, but I believe he would have gone to war with North Korea.
792	TRUMP	I think he was ready to go to war.
793	TRUMP	In fact, he told me he was so close to starting a big war with North Korea.
794	TRUMP	And where are we now?
795	TRUMP	No missiles.
796	TRUMP	No rockets.
797	TRUMP	No nuclear testing.
798	TRUMP	We've learned a lot.
799	TRUMP	But much more importantly than all of it — much more important — much, much more important that that is we have a great relationship.
800	TRUMP	I have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un.
801	TRUMP	And I've done a job.
802	TRUMP	In fact, I think I can say this: Prime Minister Abe of Japan gave me the most beautiful copy of a letter that he sent to the people who give out a thing called the Nobel Prize.
803	TRUMP	He said, "I have nominated you…" or "Respectfully, on behalf of Japan, I am asking them to give you the Nobel Peace Prize."
804	TRUMP	I said, "Thank you."
805	TRUMP	Many other people feel that way too.
806	TRUMP	I'll probably never get it, but that's okay.
807	TRUMP	They gave it to Obama.
808	TRUMP	He didn't even know what he got it for.
809	TRUMP	He was there for about 15 seconds and he got the Nobel Prize.
810	TRUMP	He said, "Oh, what did I get it for?"
811	TRUMP	With me, I probably will never get it.
812	TRUMP	But if you look at Idlib Province in Syria, I stopped the slaughter of perhaps 3 million people.
813	TRUMP	Nobody talk about that.
814	TRUMP	They don't talk about that.
815	TRUMP	Russia and Iran and Syria were going to go in and perhaps destroy 3 million people in order to get 45,000 terrorists.
816	TRUMP	And I heard about it from a woman who had her parents and her brothers living there, and she said, "Please, please."
817	TRUMP	And I thought — I said, "No, it can't happen. What are you talking about?"
818	TRUMP	"No, they're going to get…"
819	TRUMP	And I come home, and I read a certain paper where the story was there that they were actually forming to go into — to really — to really do big destruction.
820	TRUMP	And I put out a statement that "you better not do it."
821	TRUMP	And in all fairness to Russia and Iran and Syria, they didn't attack.
822	TRUMP	Or they're doing it surgically, at least.
823	TRUMP	Saved a lot of people.
824	TRUMP	We do a lot of good work.
825	TRUMP	This administration does a tremendous job, and we don't get credit for it.
826	TRUMP	But I think the people understand what we do.
827	TRUMP	So Prime Minister Abe gave me — I mean, it's the most beautiful five letter — five-page letter.
828	TRUMP	Nobel Prize.
829	TRUMP	He sent it to them.
830	TRUMP	You know why?
831	TRUMP	Because he had rocket ships and he had missiles flying over Japan.
832	TRUMP	And they had alarms going off; you know that.
833	TRUMP	Now, all of a sudden, they feel good; they feel safe.
834	TRUMP	I did that.
835	TRUMP	And it was a very tough dialogue at the beginning.
836	TRUMP	Fire and fury.
837	TRUMP	Total annihilation.
838	TRUMP	"My button is bigger than yours" and "my button works."
839	TRUMP	Remember that?
840	TRUMP	You don't remember that.
841	TRUMP	And people said, "Trump is crazy."
842	TRUMP	And you know what it ended up being?
843	TRUMP	A very good relationship.
844	TRUMP	I like him a lot and he likes me a lot.
845	TRUMP	Nobody else would have done that.
846	TRUMP	The Obama administration couldn't have done it.
847	TRUMP	Number one, they probably wouldn't have done it.
848	TRUMP	And number two, they didn't have the capability to do it.
849	TRUMP	So I just want to thank everybody.
850	TRUMP	I want to wish our Attorney General great luck and speed, and enjoy your life.
851	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
852	TRUMP	Bill, good luck.
853	TRUMP	A tremendous reputation.
854	TRUMP	I know you'll do a great job.
855	TRUMP	Thank you very much.
856	TRUMP	And thank you, everybody.
857	TRUMP	Thank you very much.
858	TRUMP	Thank you.
